# Walmart Retail Sales Forecasting

## 🎬 Project Teaser:
Ever wondered how big retailers predict weekly sales? What if you could tap into the hidden patterns of consumer behavior, holidays, and seasonal shifts to forecast future sales?

In this project, we dive deep into Walmart's weekly sales data—covering **over two years** of retail action. With **department-level granularity** and the added complexity of holiday effects, we uncover trends that shape everything from inventory to staffing. 

**What’s at stake?** Understanding these patterns could revolutionize how companies forecast demand, optimize resources, and ultimately **maximize revenue**.

🔍 Stay tuned as we explore powerful forecasting techniques and reveal the secret sauce behind retail sales success!
